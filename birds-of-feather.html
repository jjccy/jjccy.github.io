          <h2>Project Description</h2>

          <p>
            "Birds of a Feather" is a one month team VR project with Unity from class IAT 445: Immersive Environment.
            The goal of this project is to raise awareness of protecting our environment.
            The purpose is to let players get a chance to see how much garbage the animal wilderness can consume unconsciously.
            The emotion players experience throughout the game could be helplessness and shock, concern or disgust.
            Our project ties in this semester's course design challenge of environmental issues,
            we as human are living together with other species on this planet,
            protecting the environment is akin to protecting ourselves.

      <h1>Process</h1>

      <h2>Motivation & Inspiration</h2>
      <div class="flex-box text-image">

        <div class="flex-item-min">
          <p>
            Each semester the course will provide a different topic for the VR project.
            For that semester, the topic was about the environment, and our team wants to focus on
            the impacts of human pollution on wild animals.
          </p>
          <p>
            We draw inspiration from Jenny Jinya's short comic "Seabirds and Plastics from u",
            which uses personification and exaggeration to illustrate how seabirds are affected by human pollution.
            Use this short comic as inspiration, we quickly confirmed one key concept: birds can't tell
            the difference between food and garbage. Base on this concept the rough storyline and the
            general UX finish in no time, myself and one other team member constantly fixing the
            storyline and event to better tell the story.

      <h2>Storyline</h2>

      <p>
        The story begins with the introduction of the character’s role. Beginning as a human,
        you are transported into the essence of an egg. After hatching, you become a baby
        bird. Each day you are brought food by your care-providing mother-bird. Your goal is
        to feed and survive the harsh conditions of the natural environment. You will be
        eating the food collected by your mother, but some of it will be garbage and you counldn't
        tell. The player will be able to explore the nest while mother soars through the
        sky and will pick up food for the young bird. Both birds need to eat to survive,
        both the baby bird and big bird will become sick when they consume too much garbage-food.
      </p>

      <p>A quick storyboard about what happens in VR world and in real world:</p>

      <div id="horizontal-images" class="flex-box">
        <div class="flex-item-min">
          <img id="modal1" class="modalImage" onclick="modalClick(1)" src="img/bof/bof-storyboard1-min.png" alt="project storyboard 1">

        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Mechanism</h2>
      <p>
        Once the general storyline is confirmed, we separate the workload and work on our own parts.
        While my teammates are working on most of the models and animations, I was responsible for
        most of almost all the mechanisms and most of the codes. The very first thing I was
        working are the two most important mechanisms: break free from the egg and auto spawn food.
      </p>

      <div class="flex-box text-image">

        <div class="flex-item-min">
          <p>
            The first one I was working on breaks free from the egg with the virtual beak
            attaches at the player's mouth position. Detect if the beak hits the egg
            is the easy part, collision detection will do the work, the hard part is
            where egg cracks open after some hits.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first thing to do is to model the egg that is about to hatch. Once got that,
            the next thing is to make this egg model breaks into small pieces, which took most
            of the time on this mechanism. The basic idea is simple: when beak hits
            the egg more than a certain number, replace the original egg with the egg has cracks,
            the egg breaks. The Challenge thing is how to let the crack egg "explode".
            My solution is to make all eggshells collider a bit bigger than it looks.
            Therefore, when the egg is replaced with the cracked egg, all eggshells
            collide into each other, which gets pushed away by the physics engine, create
            the explosion effect. Once some sound effects and artificial shaking is added,
            the whole mechanism is done.
          </p>

            The mother bird's only mission in this game is to feed her babies,
            therefore, it needs to spawn foods when needed. I was having challenges
            when creating this mechanism, I got the food that needs to spawn,
            but how to spawn them? I wasn't sure how to achieve this problem until
            I found a tutorial about how to create a functional gun in Unity, which
            teaches how to create a duplicate for designed objects at a designed location.
            To prevent having too much copy of food will slow the running speed,
            I also make the copy food self destroy after some time period.

            Not all mechanisms could stay until the end, there are a lot of mechanisms were
            change or even delete at the end. The video on the side is a pitch video
            made in the middle of the project, it got most of the model and the
            environment at the final version but still, lack of detail.
          </p>

        </div>

        <div id="cut-out-video" class="flex-item-min">

      <p>
        You could tell from the video in our original design, player could visit
        outside of the nest. However, this is soon removed after this video because
        it gives the player too much freedom instead of experience the story. Original
        the game also has day and night, the entire story happens across couple
        days in-game time, but we realize that it will cause the story become too
        lengthy, players will get bored before the end of the story.

            While players couldn't identify the difference between foods and garbage
            also didn't realize what they were eating might be garbage, we thought a lot
            of ways to hint what they were eating might be garbage. These include but not limited to:
          </p>

          <ul class="clear-list">
            <li>apply different physics on food and garbage</li>
            <li>human action and conversation at the side</li>
            <li>slowly reveal the blur filter on food and garbage as time pass</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            There are many more fun ideas like this, but one of the most interesting ideas
            was inspired by how birds and humans see colour differently. We were thinking
            to change all colour in the game world to a different colour palate to "mimic"
            how birds see the world. In that case, players won't tell the difference
            between cigarettes and worm, other than its movement.
          </p>

          <p>
            This idea finally got redesigned because it is too aline like, which
            will break the immersive. However, it helps us to re-think our approach
            and lead us to the current way to create models for food and garbage.

      <h1>Reflection</h1>
      <p>
        I have learned a lot about Unity, VR game design and environment design through
        this project. This project teaches me how to create a proper VR game
        as well as the difference between the VR games and non-VR games.
        In the future, I want to add more storylines to the game. Currently, it is lack of story
        due to the COVID-19's impact. If possible, I would also want to upgrade the player's control and
        the character model for a better experience.
